\begin{abstract}
Anomalous transport, such as T-linear resistivity (a hallmark of non-Fermi liquid behavior), is a ubiquitous feature of strongly correlated metallic systems, but famously difficult to understand theoretically. For relevant simple models, the transport computations of even numerically exact Monte Carlo simulations are subject to enormous systematic errors and come at great additional computational cost. Building on earlier work, we apply quantum loop topography (QLT) and supervised learning on quantum Monte Carlo data to examine the Fermi liquid to non-Fermi liquid crossover in models of both Ising nematic and \cb{antiferromagnetic} spin density wave quantum criticality. Previous work on these models has demonstrated this crossover using measurements of correlation functions at nonzero imaginary time separation. Our results, using only equal time measurements, show good agreement with these previous results at dramatically lower computational cost. Hence, QLT-based machine learning can accelerate the exploration of parameter space in search for non-Fermi liquid behavior by obviating the need for expensive dynamical measurements.

[6 ML architecture and preprocessing -- Trey FIG \ref{fig:qlt}]
\textcolor{blue}{Trey: Very bare bones at the moment, just a statement of the model architecture and training process}\\
Following previous efforts \cite{Zhang2019}, equal-time Green's function data was processed using quantum loop topography (QLT) as input data for our classification tasks. The QLT-preprocessed data consists of vectors of chained products of equal-time Green's functions that form both triangular and quadrilateral loops on the lattice sites. After the data is preprocessed, it is fed to a feed-forward fully-connected shallow neural network with one hidden layer of $n=10$ sigmoid neurons. Prior to the output layer, batch normalization is performed on the hidden layer. The network is trained on a dataset consisting of 8000 equal-time samples of Green's functions for the Nematic model and 4000 equal-time samples of Green's functions for the SDW model, where 10\% of the data is partitioned into a validation set used for early stopping during training. The network is trained using stochastic gradient descent with a binary cross-entropy cost function, L2 regularization to avoid over-fitting, and a mini-batch size of 16. \\

[7 SDW model action and what is known -- Carsten]
As a first principle model, we consider a system of itinerant fermions coupled to antiferromagnetic spin-density wave order in which quantum critical fluctuations give rise to high-temperature superconductivity and lead to fermionic quasiparticle decoherence beyond the Fermi liquid paradigm \cite{Bauer2020, Schattner2016, Gerlach2017, Liu2018}.
Specifically, we focus our analysis on the sign-problem free \cite{Berg2012, Wu2005} two-dimensional spin-fermion model of Refs.~\cite{Schattner2016, Gerlach2017, Zhang2019}, which have determined the quantum critical properties in extensive, numerically exact DQMC studies. The action of the system is given by $S = S_\psi + S_\varphi + S_\lambda$,
\begin{eqnarray}
S_\psi &=&  - \int_{\tau, \mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'}} \sum_{s, \alpha} \left[ \left(\partial_\tau - \mu\right)\delta_{\mathbf{r}\mathbf{r'}} - t_{\alpha \mathbf{r}\mathbf{r'}} \right] \psi_{\alpha \mathbf{r}s}^\dagger \psi_{\alpha \mathbf{r'}s} \nonumber\\
S_\varphi &=& \int_{\tau,\mathbf{r}} \frac{1}{2c^2} \left(\partial_\tau \vec{\varphi}\right)^2 + \left(\nabla \vec{\varphi} \right)^2 + \frac{r}{2}\vec \varphi^2 + \frac{u}{4} (\vec \varphi^2)^2 \label{eq:afmetal}\\
S_\lambda &=& \lambda \int_{\tau, \mathbf{r}} e^{i \mathbf{Q}\cdot \mathbf{r_i}} \vec{\varphi}_\mathbf{r} \cdot \left( \psi_{a\mathbf{r}s}^\dagger \vec{\sigma}_{ss'}  \psi_{b\mathbf{r}s'} + \textrm{h.c.} \right), \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha=a,b$ is a fermion flavor index and $s=\uparrow, \downarrow$ denotes spin. $S_\psi$ describes the free kinetics of two flavors of spin-1/2 fermions $\psi_{\alpha \mathbf{r} s}$ situated on a square lattice. The antiferromagnetic order parameter $\varphi$ is of easy-plane character and is governed by a $O(2)$ symmetric $\varphi^4$-theory. The contribution $S_\lambda$ is a Yukawa-like spin-density coupling with an ordering wave vector $\mathbf{Q} = (\pi,\pi)$, which connects different scattering hot spots on the Fermi surface. All parameters are chosen as for Fig.~2b in Ref.~\cite{Gerlach2017}, namely $\lambda=1.5$, $c=3$ and $u=1$.

It is instructive to discuss the findings of Ref.~\cite{Gerlach2017}, as they will serve as an important guide and benchmark for our QLT analysis. The traditional method for locating the SDW phase transition of model~\eqref{eq:afmetal} is based on a finite-size scaling analysis of antiferromagnetic correlations: Given that the transition is of Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless type the phase boundary of the ordered state is characterized by the universal critical exponent $\eta = 1/4$. Tracing the transition down to $T=0$ one obtains an estimate for the QCP location of about $r_c = 0.62$ \cite{Gerlach2017}. At finite temperatures above this QCP, the Matsubara self-energy at the hot spots is found to be almost constant indicating a non-Fermi liquid state in which quasiparticles have lost their coherence \cite{Gerlach2017}.\cb{Should we mention the computational cost of these calculations?}

[10 Nematic action and what is known -- Sam]\\
Nematic quantum criticality has been extensively explored in Ref.~\cite{Lederer4905} on the basis of a lattice model. The model's degrees of freedom are spin 1/2 fermions $c_{i,\sigma}$ that live on the sites $i$ of a square lattice, and pseudospins $\tau_{i,j}$ that live on the nearest neighbor bonds $\left<i,j\right>$. The Hamiltonian is $H = H_{f} + H_{b} + H_{int}$, where $H_{f}$ is a free fermion band structure with nearest neighbor hopping and arbitrary filling, $H_{b}$ is an Ising model with transverse field $h$ whose ordered state breaks the lattice rotation symmetry, and $H_{int}$ couples the fermion and pseudospin sectors:
\begin{align*}
    H_{int} &= \alpha t\sum_{\left<i,j\right>,\sigma}\tau^{z}_{i,j}c_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{j\sigma}
\end{align*}
 With this coupling, the fermions develop an anisotropic hopping in the phase where the pseudospins order. 
 
For sufficiently strong coupling $\alpha$, this model exhibits high temperature superconductivity with a maximum in the critical temperature $T_{c}$ near $h_{c} = 2.6$ the approximate position of the quantum critical point. For $h$ near $h_{c}$, and in a range of temperature above $T_{c}$, the fermion self-energy exhibits a strongly non-fermi liquid dependence on Matsubara frequency, as well as transport signatures consistent with bad metallic behavior (though the challenges of analytic continuation prevent any definitive classification), by contrast for larger $h$ the system's behavior is consistent with fermi liquid theory.
% \begin{align*}
%     H &= H_{f} + H_{b} + H_{int} \\
%     H_{f} &= -t\sum_{\left<i,j\right>,\sigma}c_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{j\sigma}-\mu \sum_{i\sigma}c_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{i\sigma} \\
%     H_{b} &= V \sum_{\left<\left<i,j\right>;\left<k,l\right>\right>}\tau^{z}_{i,j}\tau^{z}_{k,l}-h\sum_{\left<i,j\right>}\tau^{x}_{i,j}\\
%     H_{int} &= \alpha t\sum_{\left<i,j\right>,\sigma}\tau^{z}_{i,j}c_{i\sigma}^{\dagger}c_{j\sigma}
