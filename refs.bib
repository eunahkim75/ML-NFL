	abstract = {We report on numerically exact determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the onset of spin-density wave (SDW) order in itinerant electron systems captured by a sign-problem-free two-dimensional lattice model. Extensive measurements of the SDW correlations in the vicinity of the phase transition reveal that the critical dynamics of the bosonic order parameter are well described by a dynamical critical exponent z = 2, consistent with Hertz-Millis theory, but are found to follow a finite-temperature dependence that does not fit the predicted behavior of the same theory. The presence of critical SDW fluctuations is found to have a strong impact on the fermionic quasiparticles, giving rise to a dome-shaped superconducting phase near the quantum critical point. In the superconducting state we find a gap function that has an opposite sign between the two bands of the model and is nearly constant along the Fermi surface of each band. Above the superconducting {\$}T{\_}c{\$} our numerical simulations reveal a nearly temperature and frequency independent self energy causing a strong suppression of the low-energy quasiparticle spectral weight in the vicinity of the hot spots on the Fermi surface. This indicates a clear breakdown of Fermi liquid theory around these points.},

	abstract = {We study the onset of spin-density wave order in itinerant electron systems via a two-dimensional lattice model amenable to numerically exact, sign-problem-free determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The finite-temperature phase diagram of the model reveals a dome-shaped {\$}d{\$}-wave superconducting phase near the magnetic quantum phase transition. Above the critical superconducting temperature, we observe an extended fluctuation regime, which manifests itself in the opening of a gap in the electronic density of states and an enhanced diamagnetic response. While charge density wave fluctuations are moderately enhanced in the proximity of the magnetic quantum phase transition, they remain short-ranged. The striking similarity of our results to the phenomenology of many unconventional superconductors points a way to a microscopic understanding of such strongly coupled systems in a controlled manner.},

@article{Berg2012,
	abstract = {The quantum theory of antiferromagnetism in metals is necessary for our understanding of numerous intermetallic compounds of widespread interest. In these systems, a quantum critical point emerges as external parameters (such as chemical doping) are varied. Because of the strong coupling nature of this critical point and the “sign problem” plaguing numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods, its theoretical understanding is still incomplete. Here, we show that the universal low-energy theory for the onset of antiferromagnetism in a metal can be realized in lattice models, which are free from the sign problem and hence can be simulated efficiently with QMC. Our simulations show Fermi surface reconstruction and unconventional spin-singlet superconductivity across the critical point.},

@article{Liu2018,
	abstract = {Metallic quantum criticality is among the central themes in the understanding of correlated electronic systems, and converging results between analytical and numerical approaches are still under review. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation technique and systematically investigate the itinerant quantum critical point on a 2D square lattice with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations at wavevector Q = ( $\pi$ , $\pi$ ) —a problem that resembles the Fermi surface setup and low-energy antiferromagnetic fluctuations in high-Tc cuprates and other critical metals, which might be relevant to their non–Fermi-liquid behaviors. System sizes of 60 × 60 × 320 ( L × L × L $\tau$ ) are comfortably accessed, and the quantum critical scaling behaviors are revealed with unprecedented high precision. We found that the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations introduce effective interactions among fermions and the fermions in return render the bare bosonic critical point into a different universality, different from both the bare Ising universality class and the Hertz–Mills–Moriya RPA prediction. At the quantum critical point, a finite anomalous dimension $\eta$ ∼ 0.125 is observed in the bosonic propagator, and fermions at hotspots evolve into a non-Fermi liquid. In the antiferromagnetically ordered metallic phase, fermion pockets are observed as the energy gap opens up at the hotspots. These results bridge the recent theoretical and numerical developments in metallic quantum criticality and can serve as the stepping stone toward final understanding of the 2D correlated fermions interacting with gapless critical excitations.},

@article{Zhang2019,
	abstract = {Quantum many-fermion systems give rise to diverse states of matter that often reveal themselves in distinctive transport properties. While some of these states can be captured by microscopic models accessible to numerical exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, it nevertheless remains challenging to numerically access their transport properties. Here we demonstrate that quantum loop topography (QLT) can be used to directly probe transport by machine learning current-current correlations in imaginary time. We showcase this approach by studying the emergence of superconducting fluctuations in the negative-U Hubbard model and a spin-fermion model for a metallic quantum critical point. For both sign-free models, we find that the QLT approach detects a change in transport in very good agreement with their established phase diagrams. These proof-of-principle calculations combined with the numerical efficiency of the QLT approach point a way to identify hitherto elusive transport phenomena such as non-Fermi liquids using machine learning algorithms.},
